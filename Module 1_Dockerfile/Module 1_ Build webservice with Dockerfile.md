# Building a Web Server with Dockerfile

## Introduction
In this guide, we will walk through the steps to build a web server using a Dockerfile. Docker is a platform that allows developers to automate the deployment of applications inside lightweight, portable containers. A Dockerfile is a script that contains a series of instructions on how to build a Docker image.

## Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your machine
- Basic knowledge of Docker and web servers
- A simple web application (e.g., a Node.js or Python app)

## Step 1: Create a Simple Web Application
First, create a simple web application. For this example, we'll use a basic Node.js application.

**app.js:**
```javascript
const http = require('http');

const hostname = '0.0.0.0';
const port = 3000;

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.statusCode = 200;
    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
    res.end('Hello, World!\n');
});

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
    console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});
```

**package.json:**
```json
{
    "name": "webserver",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "A simple web server",
    "main": "app.js",
    "scripts": {
        "start": "node app.js"
    },
    "dependencies": {
        "http": "^0.0.1-security"
    }
}
```

## Step 2: Write a Dockerfile
Create a file named `Dockerfile` in the root directory of your project. This file will contain the instructions to build the Docker image.

**Dockerfile:**
```Dockerfile
# Use the official Node.js image as the base image
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the working directory
COPY package*.json ./

# Install the dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code to the working directory
COPY . .

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 3000

# Define the command to run the application
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## Step 3: Build the Docker Image
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing your `Dockerfile`. Run the following command to build the Docker image:

```sh
docker build -t my-webserver .
```

This command tells Docker to build an image with the tag `my-webserver` using the instructions in the `Dockerfile`.

## Step 4: Run the Docker Container
Once the image is built, you can run a container using the following command:

```sh
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-webserver
```

This command maps port 3000 on your host machine to port 3000 in the container, allowing you to access the web server at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Explanation of Dockerfile Instructions
- `FROM node:14`: Specifies the base image to use. In this case, it's the official Node.js image.
- `WORKDIR /usr/src/app`: Sets the working directory inside the container.
- `COPY package*.json ./`: Copies `package.json` and `package-lock.json` to the working directory.
- `RUN npm install`: Installs the dependencies listed in `package.json`.
- `COPY . .`: Copies the rest of the application code to the working directory.
- `EXPOSE 3000`: Informs Docker that the container listens on port 3000.
- `CMD ["npm", "start"]`: Specifies the command to run the application.

## Conclusion
You have successfully built and run a web server using Docker. This guide covered creating a simple web application, writing a Dockerfile, building a Docker image, and running a Docker container. Docker makes it easy to package and deploy applications in a consistent environment.
