# Docker Volumes Lab

In this lab, you will learn how to use Docker volumes to manage persistent data in your containers. Docker volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers. By the end of this lab, you will understand how to:

- Create and manage Docker volumes
- Attach volumes to containers
- Share data between containers using volumes
- Backup and restore data from volumes

This lab includes hands-on exercises to help you practice and reinforce your understanding of Docker volumes. Make sure to follow the instructions carefully and experiment with the commands to get the most out of this learning experience.

Happy learning!
