# Introduction to Docker Server Troubleshooting

When working with Docker, you may encounter various issues that can affect the performance and functionality of your containers. Troubleshooting these issues is essential to ensure your Docker environment runs smoothly. This section provides a basic introduction to common Docker server troubleshooting techniques.

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Container Fails to Start**
    - **Check Logs**: Use `docker logs <container_id>` to view the container's logs and identify any errors.
    - **Inspect Container**: Use `docker inspect <container_id>` to get detailed information about the container's configuration and state.

2. **Network Connectivity Problems**
    - **Check Network Configuration**: Use `docker network ls` to list all networks and `docker network inspect <network_name>` to inspect a specific network.
    - **Test Connectivity**: Use tools like `ping` or `curl` within the container to test network connectivity.

3. **High Resource Usage**
    - **Monitor Resources**: Use `docker stats` to monitor the resource usage of your containers in real-time.
    - **Limit Resources**: Set resource limits using flags like `--memory` and `--cpus` when running containers.

4. **Volume Issues**
    - **Inspect Volumes**: Use `docker volume ls` to list all volumes and `docker volume inspect <volume_name>` to get details about a specific volume.
    - **Check Mounts**: Ensure that volumes are correctly mounted by inspecting the container configuration.

### Useful Commands

- `docker ps`: List running containers.
- `docker logs <container_id>`: View logs for a specific container.
- `docker inspect <container_id>`: Get detailed information about a container.
- `docker network ls`: List all Docker networks.
- `docker network inspect <network_name>`: Inspect a specific Docker network.
- `docker stats`: Display a live stream of container(s) resource usage statistics.
- `docker volume ls`: List all Docker volumes.
- `docker volume inspect <volume_name>`: Get detailed information about a specific volume.

By familiarizing yourself with these common issues and solutions, as well as the useful commands, you can effectively troubleshoot and resolve problems in your Docker environment.
