# Docker Compose Lab

Welcome to the Docker Compose Lab! In this lab, you will learn how to use Docker Compose to define and manage multi-container Docker applications. Docker Compose is a powerful tool that allows you to describe the services, networks, and volumes needed for your application in a single YAML file, making it easier to manage and deploy complex applications.

## Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
- Understand the basics of Docker Compose syntax and structure.
- Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to define a multi-container application.
- Use Docker Compose commands to manage the lifecycle of your application.
- Scale services and manage dependencies between containers.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this lab, you should have:
- Basic knowledge of Docker and containerization concepts.
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.
