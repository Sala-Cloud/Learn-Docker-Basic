# Module 5: Docker Compose

## Overview
Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application's services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

## Key Concepts
- **Services**: A service is a container in your application. Each service runs one image and can be scaled by specifying the number of containers to run.
- **Networks**: Docker Compose allows you to define networks to enable communication between services.
- **Volumes**: Volumes are used to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will be able to:
1. Understand the basics of Docker Compose.
2. Write a `docker-compose.yml` file to define multi-container applications.
3. Use Docker Compose commands to manage the lifecycle of your application.
4. Scale services to handle increased load.
5. Use volumes to persist data.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Docker and containerization.
- Docker installed on your machine.

## Topics Covered
1. **Introduction to Docker Compose**
    - What is Docker Compose?
    - Benefits of using Docker Compose.
2. **Setting Up Docker Compose**
    - Installing Docker Compose.
    - Verifying the installation.
3. **Defining Services in Docker Compose**
    - Writing a `docker-compose.yml` file.
    - Configuring services, networks, and volumes.
4. **Managing the Application Lifecycle**
    - Starting and stopping services.
    - Viewing logs and status.
5. **Scaling Services**
    - Scaling services up and down.
    - Load balancing considerations.
6. **Persisting Data with Volumes**
    - Creating and using volumes.
    - Backing up and restoring data.

## Example `docker-compose.yml`
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
     image: nginx
     ports:
        - "80:80"
  db:
     image: postgres
     environment:
        POSTGRES_PASSWORD: example
volumes:
  db_data:
```

## Commands Cheat Sheet
- `docker-compose up`: Create and start containers.
- `docker-compose down`: Stop and remove containers, networks, images, and volumes.
- `docker-compose ps`: List containers.
- `docker-compose logs`: View output from containers.
- `docker-compose scale`: Set the number of containers for a service.

## Conclusion
Docker Compose simplifies the process of managing multi-container applications. By using a single YAML file, you can define, run, and scale your application effortlessly. This module provides the foundational knowledge needed to leverage Docker Compose in your projects.
